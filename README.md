## Application of the dashboard

Each mentor can assign some students to be evaluated.

A mentor can add students which he/she is interested to evaluate satisfying the below condition.

A mentor can only accommodate minimum 3 and maximum 4 students at a time.

Mentor can also edit/remove assigned student satisfying the same conditions when adding a new student. Mentors can also edit assigned marks to students.

## Future Prospects

We can add different access control for different mentors.

We can add unit and integration testing to ensure proper functionality.

We can divide the project into submodules to enable modularity in the code.
